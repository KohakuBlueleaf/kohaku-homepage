This repository is largely odified from:
[ixartz/Astro-boilerplate: üöÄ Astro boilerplate with responsive blog and portfolio template using TypeScript and React styled with Tailwind CSS ‚ö°Ô∏è Made with developer experience first: TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier + Husky + Lint-Staged + Commitlint + VSCode](https://github.com/ixartz/Astro-boilerplate)


I removed tons of linting/deployment files to keep it clean, and use jsx for react component, and use vue3 for new components.
